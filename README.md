## Project Overview
This project contains Python scripts for analyzing mechanical and visual fibrousness parameters using machine learning models. This project contains Python scripts for analyzing mechanical and visual fibrousness parameters using machine learning models. The codes are designed to split dataset, compute data variance, and train models using linear regression, polynomial regression, random forest, neural networks, and decision tree algorithms.

## Compatibility
All Python scripts are compatible with **Python 3**. It is recommended to use Python **3.9** or later for optimal performance and compatibility.

## Headers and Dependencies
All necessary headers and imports are included in each respective script. If any missing dependencies are encountered, install them using `pip`.
